                  I founded TrueClean after a frustrating experience with
                  "premium" cleaning that was neither safe nor healthy.
                  TrueClean ensures every service uses non-toxic, eco-friendly
                  products, prioritizing safety for children, pets, and
                  sensitive individuals. Our vision redefines premium cleaning:
                  delivering spotless homes while fostering health, trust, and
                  peace of mind—because cleanliness should never compromise
                  well-being.
                  {/* A couple of years ago, a "premium" clean left our founder with
                  an overwhelming chemical smell and a massive allergic
                  reaction. This left one thing glaringly clear: spotless does
                  not mean at the expense of your health. Trueclean was born to
                  solve that gap. We created a service that treats your indoor
                  air like family - non-toxic, eco-friendly products, and a
                  methodical checklist for your home (room-by-room) so your home
                  looks spotless and feels safe to breathe. Today, our trained
                  teams are consistently offering the same standard: health
                  before cleaning, clear pricing, and to be a trustworthy
                  provider of the outcome you see fit (from nurseries and pet
                  areas to active kitchens or sensitive spaces). On behalf of
                  Trueclean, we clean with intention - we don't compromise. To
                  us, being premium means clean, shining surfaces, and peace of
                  mind how you have to navigate with your loved ones. That's how
                  we take a painful experience and turned it into a health
                  commitment: cleaner and safer living spaces, keeping your
                  family first, your time valuable, and your air safe. */}
